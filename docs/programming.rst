Programming: UNIX Shell, Text Editing, C++, and Python
======================================================

UNIX Shell
----------

The `UNIX shell <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell>`_ is going
to become your best friend. You should learn how to use it
effectively. The default shell on most Linux distributions is
``bash``. The latest version of macOS (which is 10.15, Catalina, at
time of writing) uses ``zsh``, which is very similar to bash. You
should poke around the internet to read about how they're
different.

Check out `this tutorial
<https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/>`_ to learn the basics of
working in a shell. There are also many videos online to walk you
through a lot of basics; `this one
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxuRxtrO2Ag>`_ is pretty
thorough. Operating in a shell is an incredibly powerful way to use a
computer. At least 95% of all HEP tasks are tackled via some kind of
command line interface that requires using a UNIX shell.

If you're on Windows it is highly suggested that you use `Windows
Subsystem for Linux <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/>`_.

Text Editor
-----------

To write software you'll want to get comfortable with a text editor.

The short version: Learn `GNU Emacs
<https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/>`_.

The long version: It's very useful to be comfortable with either
`Emacs <https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/>`_ or `Vim
<https://www.vim.org/>`_ (or both!). These are very old text editors
that are both very powerful and almost always installed on every UNIX
machine that you'll end up using. So when you have to ssh to another
machine, it's very useful to have some knowledge of one or both. A
more "modern" (but less powerful) text editor (that has become very
popular in recent years) is `Visual Studio Code
<https://code.visualstudio.com/>`_.

Please use your favorite search engine to learn more about your best
options for text editors. People can get `pretty religious
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war>`_ about them, as you can
probably tell from the "short version" :)

C++ and Python
--------------

The main programming languages used in HEP are C++ and Python. There
are *infinite* resources online and countless books for learning these
programming languages, so there is no point documenting the
programming languages here. The best way to learn is to dive in and
solve the problem you need to solve. Google is your friend. There are
a number of people in the Duke ATLAS group who can probably answer
most simple C++ and Python questions. Please do not hesitate to ask
programming questions to anyone in the Duke ATLAS group.

For a good introduction to programming in C++ (put together by a high
energy physicist), see `these slides
<http://webhome.phy.duke.edu/~ddavis/public/Summer2016_CPPTutorial.pdf>`_. Another
great resource is the `cppreference.com
<https://en.cppreference.com/w/>`_ website. This is exactly what it
claims to be: a reference. You won't find any tutorials here; but you
will find all of the features of the language and its standard
library.

`Real Python <https://realpython.com/>`_ is a great resource for
getting started with Python.
