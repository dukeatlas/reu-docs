UNIX Shell, C++, and Python
=========================================

The UNIX shell is going to become your best friend. You should really
learn how to use it. The defaut shell on most Linux distributions is
``bash`` (this is the default on macOS as well). This out `this
tutorial <https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/>`_.

The main programming languages used in HEP are C++ and Python. There
are *infinite* resources online for learning these programming
languages, and countless books.

For a good introduction to programming in C++ (put together by a high
energy physicist), see `these slides
<http://webhome.phy.duke.edu/~ddavis/public/Summer2016_CPPTutorial.pdf>`_. Another
great resource is the `cppreference.com
<https://en.cppreference.com/w/>`_ website. This is exactly what it
claims to be: a reference. You won't find any tutorials here; but you
will find all of the features of the language and its standard
library.

For a quick introduction to Python, see this `Learn Python in 10
minutes <https://www.stavros.io/tutorials/python/>`_ article.

The best way to learn is just to dive in and solve the problem you
need to solve. Google is your friend. There are a number of people in
the Duke ATLAS group who can probably answer most simple C++ and
Python questions. Freel free to drop a question on `Mattermost
<https://mattermost.web.cern.ch/duke/channels/summer-students-2019>`_.
