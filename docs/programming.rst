Programming in C++ and Python
=============================

The main programming languages used in HEP are C++ and Python. There
are *infinite* resources online for learning these programming
languages, and countless books.

For a good introduction to programming in C++ (put together by a high
energy physicist), see `these sides
<http://webhome.phy.duke.edu/~ddavis/public/Summer2016_CPPTutorial.pdf>`_.

For a quick introduction to Python, see this `Learn Python in 10
minutes <https://www.stavros.io/tutorials/python/>`_ article.

There are a number of people in the Duke ATLAS group who can probably
answer most simple C++ and Python questions. Freel free to drop a
question on `Mattermost
