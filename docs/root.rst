ROOT Quick Start
================

`ROOT <https://root.cern/>`_ is the main piece of software used by
high energy experimentalists for the last two decades. You'll find use
of ROOT in the majority of all ATLAS software. Luckily, ROOT can be
used independent of ATLAS software on any Linux or macOS machine. If
you do not have to use ATLAS software (that is, you have datasets that
are in pure ROOT format without any ties to the ATLAS data format),
just running ROOT on a laptop is the fastest way to develop code for
analyzing ROOT data (commonly called "ROOT ntuples").

Installing Anaconda
-------------------

The fastest way to get up and running with ROOT is to install it via
the `conda package manager <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/>`_. To
use the ``conda`` package manager we need to install the `Anaconda
Distribution <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>`_.
