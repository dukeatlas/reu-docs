ATLAS Software
==============

The ATLAS Analysis Software Group (ASG) maintains a very detailed
tutorial for getting started with ATLAS specific analysis software. If
you have to analyze downstream ATLAS datasets, so-called DAODs
(derived analysis object data), then going through this tutorial **is
absolutely necessary**. This tutorial can be found `here
