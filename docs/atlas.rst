ATLAS Software
==============

The ATLAS Analysis Software Group (ASG) maintains a very detailed
tutorial for getting started with ATLAS specific analysis software. If
you have to analyze ATLAS analysis-level datasets, so-called DAODs
(derived analysis object data), then going through this tutorial **is
absolutely necessary**. This tutorial can be found `here
<https://atlassoftwaredocs.web.cern.ch/ABtutorial/>`_. If you need to
analyze DAODs, the rest of these docs can still be useful for later
steps in your work, but the ASG tutorial is your best friend.

If you're analyzing very downstream datasets that are in a plain ROOT
ntuple format, then the rest of these docs should definitely be
useful.
