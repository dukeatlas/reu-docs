ATLAS Software
==============

The ATLAS Analysis Software Group (ASG) maintains a very detailed
tutorial for getting started with ATLAS specific analysis software. If
you have to analyze downstream ATLAS datasets, so-called DAODs
(derived analysis object data), then going through this tutorial **is
absolutely necessary**. This tutorial can be found `here
<https://atlassoftwaredocs.web.cern.ch/ABtutorial/>`_. If you need to
analyze DAODs, the rest of these docs can still be useful, but the ASG
tutorial is your best friend.

If you're analyzing end-of-stream datasets are in a plain ROOT ntuple
format, then the rest of these docs should definitely be useful.
